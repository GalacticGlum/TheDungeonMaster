# The Dungeon Master
The Dungeon Master is a 3D adventure game where the player navigates a labyrinth, trying to find their way to the exit. 

The labyrinth is comprised of 3 dungeons; each one guarded by enemies. To complete a dungeon, the player must defeat the dungeon’s boss. However, combat is done through cards which represent the players actions. Puzzles cleverly placed throughout the labyrinth further add to the complexity of the game—the player must solve the puzzle in order to advance further.
